We will use the Router, Chunker, and LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lesson 2: Loading the Vector/Document Database.** We will create indexes with which to search our data--particularly vector indexes that rely on representations of the text as vectors (embeddings). We will use the Router, Embedder, and Hybrid Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lesson 3: Evaluating Retrieval.** We will implement an interface that allows us to collect data on the performance of our app--a notoriously difficult challenge with the wide scope of many language use cases. We will use the Router, Hybrid Search, LLM, Judge UI, and Human Eval Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lesson 4: Better Generations.** We will combine the previous elements into the final web app, including an initial triage step to assess the user's intent and intelligently select the right settings for the search and LLM prompt. We will use the App, the Hybrid Search, and the LLM.\n",
